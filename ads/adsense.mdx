ShipAny integrates [Adsense](https://adsense.google.com/) as an advertising service provider. You can easily set it up with simple configuration.

## Quick Start

Follow the steps below to quickly integrate Adsense advertising service into your project.

<Steps>
<Step>Create an Adsense Account</Step>

Visit the [Adsense website](https://adsense.google.com/) and register an account.

<Step>Add a Site</Step>

In the Adsense console, go to the `Sites` page, click the `New site` button, enter your website domain (e.g., `shipany.site`) in the `Add site` popup, and click the `Save` button to add the site.

On the verification page, copy the code in the format `ca-pub-xxx`.

In the project management backend, go to the `Settings -> Ads -> Adsense` panel, and paste the code copied in the previous step into the `Adsense Code` field.

> If verification fails with the `AdSense code snippet`, try switching to `Ads.txt snippet` or `Meta tag` methods. Visit `{your-domain}/ads.txt` directly and check if the output content matches the content in the `Ads.txt snippet`.

</Steps>
