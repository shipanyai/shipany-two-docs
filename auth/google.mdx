## Quick Start

Follow these steps to configure Google Login for your project.

<Steps>
<Step>Select Google Cloud Project</Step>

Go to the Google Cloud Console and enter the [API & Services -> Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page.

Click the project selector in the upper left corner to select a project or create a new one.

<Step>Create OAuth Client</Step>

On the [API & Services -> Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page, click the `Create Credentials` button, select `OAuth client ID`, and start creating an OAuth client.

- `Application type` select `Web application`.
- `Name` fill in your project name.

Add your project domain under `Authorized javascript origins`, for example:

```shell
https://your-domain.com
```

Add your project callback address under `Authorized redirect URIs` in the format:

```shell
https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google
```

Click the `Create` button, and in the pop-up window, copy the `Client ID` and `Client secret`.

> Note: If you are creating an OAuth client for a new project, you need to complete the `OAuth consent screen` configuration first. Just follow the prompts step by step. Remember not to upload `App logo`, otherwise verification will be triggered.

<Step>Configure Google Login</Step>

In the project management dashboard, go to the `Settings -> Auth -> Google Auth` panel, and fill in the `Client ID` and `Client secret` copied in the previous step.

Turn on the `Auth Enabled` switch to enable the Google redirect login function, and turn on the `OneTap Enabled` switch to enable the Google One Tap login function.
