[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is a cloud database development platform built around PostgreSQL. It provides backend services including database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, file storage, and edge functions, exposing PostgreSQL capabilities to developers through RESTful and GraphQL APIs without the need to build your own backend services.

In ShipAny projects, you can use Supabase to store and manage your data.

## Quick Start

You can follow the steps below to integrate Supabase into your ShipAny project.

<Steps>
<Step>Register an Account</Step>

Visit the [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) website and register a Supabase account.

<Step>Create a Project</Step>

Go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and create a project.

Enter the project name, click `Generate a password` to generate a random password, then click the `Copy` button to copy the password.

<Step>Get Database Connection URL</Step>

Go to the project management page created in the previous step, click the `Connect` button at the top, switch to the `ORMs -> Drizzle` tab, and copy the value of `DATABASE_URL`.

Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with the random password generated in the previous step to get the database connection URL for your Supabase project. It should look like this:

```shell
postgresql://postgres.seilzcqsafesmugglqlk:xxxxxx@aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

<Step>Test Database Connection</Step>

Use the `psql` tool to test if the database can connect normally.

```shell
psql "postgresql://postgres.seilzcqsafesmugglqlk:xxxxxx@aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
```

> Please search for the installation method of the `psql` tool yourself. Generally, after installing `PostgreSQL` locally, the `psql` tool will be included.

<Step>Configure Database</Step>

Refer to the [Configure Database](/docs/quick-start#configure-database) documentation to configure the database for your ShipAny project.
