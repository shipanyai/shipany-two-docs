title: System Architecture
---

`ShipAny Two` is based on the latest `Next.js 16`, with significant improvements in compilation performance, faster local development, and lower memory usage.

At the framework design level, it is divided into six major components: core systems, core modules, extension modules, theme system, configuration system, and content management system.

## 1. Core Systems (app)

ShipAny Two includes three core systems: Landing, Admin, and User Console, corresponding to three independent page layouts, used to implement three common business functions: website landing pages, admin management, and user centers.

- Landing Page System (Landing)

Page content is controlled through JSON files, making it easy for AI to modify and supporting multiple languages; pages are split into blocks, allowing free assembly with high flexibility; colors and fonts can be adjusted through theme.css with high personalization

- Admin Management System (Admin)

Integrates user management, order management, and points management functions; includes a configuration center for visually enabling/disabling various features; integrates CRUD operations, allowing data management pages (table, form) to be rendered with just a few lines of code through a custom PageBuilder

- User Console System (User Console)

Users manage their bills, subscriptions, payments, and points transactions in the Settings panel, and modify avatars and nicknames; users view AI generation tasks and AI conversation records in the Activity panel

The three core systems are implemented in the `src/app` directory, organized by functionality, making it easy for developers to add their own features.

## 2. Core Modules (core)

ShipAny categorizes framework-wide supported features as core modules, including db, auth, i18n, and rbac

- Database (db)

Database functionality integrated based on drizzle orm, supporting database types such as postgres, mysql, sqlite; data tables defined through schema, supporting incremental migration; CRUD data operations use the same SQL syntax, smoothing out differences between various databases

- Authentication (auth)

Authentication functionality implemented based on better-auth, allowing common login methods to be enabled with one click in the admin dashboard

- Role-Based Access Control (rbac)

Permission-based management control, controlling access to the admin management system through custom roles and permission nodes

- Internationalization (i18n)

Internationalization functionality implemented based on next-intl, controlling multilingual display through JSON files

ShipAny's core modules are defined under `src/core`

## 3. Extension Modules (extensions)

ShipAny uses extensions to support a pluggable architecture, with each type of extension defining a unified interface, and each extension implementing specific functional logic according to the interface. Currently supported extensions include

- ads

Advertising. Integrates adsense

- affiliate

Affiliate marketing. Integrates affonso, promotekit

- ai

AI providers. Integrates OpenRouter, Fal, Replicate, Kie

- analytics

Data analytics. Integrates ga, clarity, plausible, open-panel, vercel-analytics

- customer-service

Customer service. Integrates crisp, tawk

- email

Email. Integrates resend

- payment

Payment. Integrates Stripe, Creem, PayPal

- storage

Storage. Integrates aws s3, cloudflare r2

ShipAny's extension modules are defined in the `src/extensions` directory. To add a new option for each type of extension, only a small amount of code needs to be written

## 4. Theme System (themes)

ShipAny supports a multi-theme system, allowing developers to customize themes for personalized page display.

Includes three types of theme customization methods

- Custom theme colors / fonts
- Switch between light / dark mode
- Custom theme folders

The theme system is defined under `src/themes`

## 5. Configuration System (config)

ShipAny supports three types of configuration definitions

- Define configuration through environment variables in .env files
- Define configuration through files in the src/config directory
- Visually manage configuration in /admin/settings

Combining configuration management items to achieve low-code functionality, allowing users who don't understand code well to easily use ShipAny

## 6. Content Management System (cms)

ShipAny's content management system includes three levels of content management

- Blog

Write blog content through the admin dashboard, or write blogs using markdown in the content/posts directory. Blogs can increase SEO weight for your website and also accept business orders through guest posts.

- Documentation (docs)

Documentation system implemented based on fumadocs, write content in the content/docs directory, and render a /docs documentation for your website in minutes

- Pages

Write content in the content/pages directory to dynamically create pages, such as common website policy pages /privacy-policy and /terms-of-service
