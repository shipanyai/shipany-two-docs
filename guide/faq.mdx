## Can't ShipAny Two code repository be forked?

Private repositories do not support forking. You need to create your own private Github repository to save your project code.

## How to sync ShipAny Two updates?

1. Clone the ShipAny Two code repository first to initialize your own project

```shell
git clone git@github.com:shipanyai/shipany-template-two my-shipany-project
```

2. Create a private Github repository for your project

For example, you created a private repository on Github to save your project code, the repository address is: `github.com/idoubi/my-shipany-project`

3. Push the project code to your private Github repository

```shell
# Enter project root directory
cd my-shipany-project
# Modify code hosting address
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:idoubi/my-shipany-project.git
# Push code
git push origin main
```

4. Set the ShipAny Two code repository as your project's upstream repository

```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:shipanyai/shipany-template-two.git
```

5. Sync ShipAny Two updates

```shell
# Fetch updates from upstream repository
git fetch upstream
# Merge updates from upstream repository
git merge upstream/main
# Push code to your private Github repository
git push origin main
```

You can update the latest ShipAny Two code as needed. If the upstream code conflicts with your project code, you need to resolve the conflict manually.

After updating the code, remember to install project dependencies.

```shell
pnpm install
```

> If the upstream code changes are large, please be cautious when syncing. You can use the [cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) command to only sync the changes you need.

## How to update database table structures?

After synchronizing the upstream code, remember to update the database table structures to ensure that your project can synchronize the data table changes of the upstream.

```shell
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```
