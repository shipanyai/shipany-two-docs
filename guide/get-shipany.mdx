- Can I buy it without programming basics?

It is recommended to know some HTML / CSS / JavaScript basics, and familiarity with Typescript / React / NextJS is better.

Complete zero foundation requires certain learning ability, at least you can set up a local development environment with the help of AI, and be able to implement custom functions through AI-assisted programming.

ShipAny templates lower the development threshold, but having some programming basics can make better use of it.
