title: Prerequisites
---

To ensure you can successfully use ShipAny to develop your project, please make sure you have completed the following prerequisites.

## Network Environment

Please ensure your network environment can normally access third-party services such as [Github](https://github.com/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/).

You can execute the following command in the terminal to check your network exit IP:

```shell
curl https://ipinfo.io
```

Test network connectivity with the following command:

```shell
curl https://google.com
```

If the network environment is poor, it may cause issues such as inability to install required `npm` dependencies, inability to connect to cloud databases, and inability to use AI image generation features.

## Set Up Local Development Environment

Please set up your local development environment and install necessary development tools according to your operating system. Using `Mac OS` as an example:

1. Install [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for NodeJS version management

It is recommended to use the following or higher versions of `NodeJS` and `npm`:

```bash
$ node -v
v22.2.0

$ npm -v
10.7.0
```

2. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for package management

Install `pnpm` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g pnpm
```

It is recommended to use the following or higher version of `pnpm`:

```bash
$ pnpm -v
9.15.0
```

3. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control

It is recommended to use the following or higher version of `git`:

```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.39.3 (Apple Git-146)
```

4. Configure [ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to ensure you can access your Github repository

```bash
$ ssh -T git@github.com
```

## AI-Assisted Programming Tools

To better understand the ShipAny framework and develop projects more efficiently, it is recommended to use the following AI tools to assist development:

| Name                                                      | Description             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)                         | AI Editor               |
| [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)                | AI Editor               |
| [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) | AI Programming CLI Tool |
| [CodeX](https://openai.com/codex/)                        | AI Programming CLI Tool |

Installing the following plugins in AI editors can better assist development:
