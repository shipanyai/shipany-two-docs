import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

ShipAny supports dynamic page building. You can render a dynamic page with just a JSON file, without writing any code.

Dynamic page files are defined in the `src/config/locale/messages/{locale}/pages` directory. One file corresponds to one page, and multi-language support is available.

In dynamic page files, landing pages are rendered by combining blocks.

## Create a New Dynamic Page

For example, let's create a landing page for `AI Image Generator` with the access route `/features/ai-image-generator`. You can quickly create it by following the steps below.

<Steps>

<Step>Create a dynamic page file</Step>

Create the `features/ai-image-generator.json` file in the `src/config/locale/messages/en/pages` directory.

Write the page content:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "AI Image Generator",
    "description": "Generate images with AI models, support text-to-image and image-to-image."
  },
  "page": {
    "sections": {
      "hero": {
        "title": "AI Image Generator",
        "description": "Generate images with AI models, support text-to-image and image-to-image.",
        "image": {
          "src": "/imgs/features/3.png",
          "alt": "hero image"
        },
        "background_image": {
          "src": "/imgs/bg/tree.jpg",
          "alt": "hero background"
        },
        "buttons": [
          {
            "title": "Start Creating",
            "url": "#create",
            "icon": "Sparkles"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Step>Configure the page file</Step>

Add the newly created dynamic page file to the `localeMessagesPaths` array exported from the `src/config/locale/index.ts` file:

```ts
export const localeMessagesPaths = [
  // ... other dynamic page file list
  'pages/features/ai-image-generator',
];
```

<Step>Preview the dynamic page</Step>

When you visit the `/features/ai-image-generator` page, you'll see:

We've rendered a dynamic page with just a JSON file, without writing any code.

<Step>Configure multi-language dynamic pages</Step>

If your project needs to support multi-language access to dynamic pages, you need to create corresponding dynamic page files for each language in the `src/config/locale/messages/{locale}/pages` directory.

For example, for the page created above, to display a Chinese page with the access route `/zh/features/ai-image-generator`, you need to create the `features/ai-image-generator.json` file in the `src/config/locale/messages/zh/pages` directory.

Write the same structure as the English page file, but translate the content into the corresponding language.

> The `localeMessagesPaths` array exported from `src/config/locale/index.ts` does not need to add corresponding dynamic page files for each language.

</Steps>

## Add Display Blocks

In the JSON file of a dynamic page, `metadata` defines the page title and description to be displayed in the browser title bar and search engines. Properly setting the `title` and `description` in `metadata` can help search engines better understand and index newly created pages.

The `page.sections` field defines the list of blocks to be displayed on the page. For example, if we want to display three blocks (`hero` / `faq` / `cta`) on the `ai-image-generator` page, we can configure it as follows:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "AI Image Generator",
    "description": "Generate images with AI models, support text-to-image and image-to-image."
  },
  "page": {
    "sections": {
      "hero": {
        "title": "AI Image Generator",
        "description": "Generate images with AI models, support text-to-image and image-to-image.",
        "buttons": [
          {
            "title": "Start Creating",
            "url": "#create",
            "icon": "Sparkles"
          }
        ],
        "show_bg": false
      },
      "faq": {
        "title": "FAQ",
        "description": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "items": [
          {
            "title": "What is AI Image Generator?",
            "description": "AI Image Generator is a tool that allows you to generate images with AI models, support text-to-image and image-to-image."
          }
        ]
      },
      "cta": {
        "title": "Ready to Create Images?",
        "description": "Start creating images with AI models, support text-to-image and image-to-image.",
        "buttons": [
          {
            "title": "Start Creating",
            "url": "#create",
            "icon": "Sparkles"
          }
        ],
        "className": "bg-muted"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When you visit the `/features/ai-image-generator` page, you'll see:

### Block Type Definition

In dynamic page files, the list of blocks to be displayed is defined through `page.sections`. The field type of `page.sections` is `Record<string, Section>`, where the `Section` type is defined as:

```ts
export interface Section {
  id?: string;
  block?: string;
  label?: string;
  sr_only_title?: string;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  tip?: string;
  buttons?: Button[];
  icon?: string | ReactNode;
  image?: Image;
  image_invert?: Image;
  items?: SectionItem[];
  image_position?: 'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom' | 'center';
  text_align?: 'left' | 'center' | 'right';
  className?: string;
  component?: ReactNode;
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

The blocks we add to the `page.sections` field in dynamic page files should follow the fields defined by the `Section` type. The block code to be displayed is located based on the block's `key` or the `block` field in the block content.

For example, if we want to display a features list block, we can add it to `page.sections`:

```json
{
  "page": {
    "sections": {
      "features": {
        "block": "features-list",
        "title": "Features List",
        "description": "Features List",
        "items": [
          {
            "title": "Feature 1 Title",
            "description": "Feature 1 Description",
            "icon": "Sparkles"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

According to the definition above, when rendering the dynamic page, it will load the `src/themes/default/blocks/features-list.tsx` file by default to render the features list block.

If the `block` field is not specified, it will load the `src/themes/default/blocks/features.tsx` file by default to render the features list block. `features` here is the block's `key`.

`features` and `features-list` are built-in blocks in ShipAny's default theme, so they can be displayed directly once configured.

### Built-in Block List

ShipAny includes the following built-in blocks in the default theme:

- `hero`: Hero block
- `logos`: Logo list block
- `features`: Features block
- `features-list`: Features list block
- `features-accordion`: Features accordion block
- `features-flow`: Features flow block
- `features-media`: Features media block
- `features-step`: Features step block
- `showcases`: Showcases block
- `showcases-flow`: Showcases flow block
- `stats`: Statistics block
- `testimonials`: Testimonials block
- `faq`: FAQ block
- `cta`: Call-to-action block
- `subscribe`: Subscribe block

You can specify the block to be displayed in dynamic page files through the `block` field, and pass the content to be displayed by the block according to the `Section` type definition.

## Custom Display Blocks

If the built-in blocks don't meet your needs, you can create custom display blocks.

<Steps>

<Step>Create a custom block file</Step>

Create a custom block file in the `src/themes/default/blocks` directory.

For example, create a `custom-features.tsx` file to customize the display of a features list.

```tsx
import { cn } from '@/shared/lib/utils';
import { Section } from '@/shared/types/blocks/landing';

export function CustomFeatures({
  section,
  className,
}: {
  section: Section;
  className?: string;
}) {
  return (
    <section
      id={section.id}
      className={cn('py-16 md:py-24', section.className)}
    >
      <div className="container">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">{section.title}</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">{section.description}</p>
        <ul className="mt-8 grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
          {section.items?.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.id} className="rounded-md border p-4">
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{item.title}</h3>
              <p className="text-sm">{item.description}</p>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

<Step>Configure the custom block</Step>

Specify the custom block through the `block` field in the dynamic page file.

```json
{
  "page": {
    "sections": {
      "features": {
        "block": "custom-features",
        "title": "Custom Features",
        "description": "Custom Features of AI Image Generator",
        "items": [
          {
            "title": "Text to Image",
            "description": "Generate images with AI models, support text-to-image and image-to-image."
          },
          {
            "title": "Image to Image",
            "description": "Generate images with AI models, support image-to-image."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Step>Preview the custom block</Step>

When you visit the dynamic page, you'll see:

You can use AI to modify the code of custom blocks to achieve more expressive UI effects.
