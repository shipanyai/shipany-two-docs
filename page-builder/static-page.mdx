ShipAny supports static page building. You can render a static page with just a Markdown file, without writing any code.

Static page files are defined in the `content/pages` directory. One file corresponds to one page, and multi-language support is available.

## Default Static Pages

The template includes two built-in static pages:

- Terms of Service page

The access route is `/terms-of-service`, and the corresponding file is `content/pages/terms-of-service.mdx`.

- Privacy Policy page

The access route is `/privacy-policy`, and the corresponding file is `content/pages/privacy-policy.mdx`.

For example, when you visit the privacy policy page, you'll see:

> Static pages support multi-language display. For example, if your project needs to display a Chinese privacy policy page, the access route is `/zh/privacy-policy`, and you need to create the static page file: `content/pages/privacy-policy.zh.mdx`.

## Create a New Static Page

You can follow the steps below to create a new static page.

For example, let's create a company introduction page with the access route `/about/company`:

<Steps>

<Step>Create a static page file</Step>

Create the `about/company.mdx` file in the `content/pages` directory.

Write the page content:

```mdx

title: ShipAny Company
description: Introduction about our company
created_at: 2025-12-05

## Company Introduction

> Write the page content in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format. The `title`, `description`, and `created_at` fields wrapped in `---` at the beginning of the file are optional and are used to set the page title, description, and creation time.

<Step>Preview the static page</Step>

When you visit the `/about/company` page, you'll see:

<Step>Configure multi-language static pages</Step>

If your project needs to support multi-language access to static pages, you need to create corresponding static page files for each language.

For example, to access the `/ja/about/company` page, the corresponding static page file is `content/pages/about/company.ja.mdx`.

> `content/pages` is the root directory for static page files. You can create multi-level subdirectories under this directory. For example, you can create a `content/pages/foo/bar/abc.mdx` file, and the corresponding access route is `/foo/bar/abc`.

</Steps>
