ShipAny supports using [Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) to enhance [Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding).

In the ShipAny template, the `.claude/skills` directory comes with a set of commonly used Agent Skills to help your Coding Agent implement features quickly.

## Quickly bootstrap a project

The ShipAny template includes a skill named `shipany-quick-start`, defined in `.claude/skills/shipany-quick-start`.

With this skill, you can bootstrap a new project and ship a first version from a one-sentence description.

Using a `Nano Banana Generator` project as an example, here’s the workflow for building the first version with `shipany-quick-start`:

<Steps>

<Step>Create the project from the template</Step>

Clone the latest ShipAny template to create a new project.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:shipanyai/shipany-template-two my-shipany-project
```

Open the project in your editor and confirm that `.claude/skills/shipany-quick-start` exists at the repo root.

<Step>Trigger the skill with a prompt</Step>

Open a Coding Agent (such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview), or [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/)). In the chat, enter the prompt below to initialize the project with the `shipany-quick-start` skill.

You only need to provide the project name, domain, content reference link, etc.

```txt
use shipany-quick-start skill to start my new project.
Project name is Nano Banana Generator,
domain is: nano-banana-generator.com,
content reference: https://gemini.google/overview/image-generation/
```

> Note: Skill discovery and usage can be probabilistic — not every Coding Agent will reliably find and use the exact skill you specified every time.

- Skill discovery and invocation depends in part on how the Coding Agent is implemented.

For example, Claude Code discovers skills under `.claude/skills` by default. Codex uses `.codex/skills`. Other Coding Agents may support `.claude/skills`, or they may use a custom skill directory.

You can explicitly specify the skill path in your prompt, for example: `use ".claude/skills/shipany-quick-start" to start my new project.`

Or copy the template skills into your Coding Agent’s skill directory, for example: `cp -r .claude/skills .codex/skills`.

- Different models can also behave differently in how they discover and use skills.

For example, in Cursor’s Coding Agent, models like `Auto`, `GPT-5.2`, and `Opus 4.5` often have a higher success rate for discovering and invoking skills.

Try switching models to see what works best.

<Step>Use the skill to finish bootstrapping</Step>

After the skill is triggered, the Coding Agent will plan and execute the workflow defined in `shipany-quick-start` to complete the project bootstrap.

The first version typically includes:

- Create environment variable files: `.env.development` and `.env.production`
- Generate the project Logo and Favicon: `public/logo.png` and `public/favicon.ico`
- Update the sitemap: `public/sitemap.xml`
- Update common site info: `src/config/locale/messages/{locale}/common.json`
- Update branding and navigation: `src/config/locale/messages/{locale}/landing.json`
- Update the landing page content: `src/config/locale/messages/{locale}/pages/index.json`
- Update Privacy Policy and Terms of Service: `content/pages/privacy-policy*.mdx` and `content/pages/terms-of-service*.mdx`
- Update theme styles: `src/config/style/theme.css`

<Step>Preview the project</Step>

After initialization, open the project preview URL in your browser to see the first version.

The images shown on the page are random placeholders generated by [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/).

The project Logo and Favicon are generated by scripts defined in the skill.

You can keep editing the content and replace the Logo, Favicon, and placeholder images as needed.

</Steps>

With the steps above, you can use `shipany-quick-start` to quickly bootstrap a project and ship its first version.

## Quickly create a subpage

The ShipAny template also includes a skill named `shipany-page-builder`, defined in `.claude/skills/shipany-page-builder`.

With this skill, you can quickly create a subpage in your project from a one-sentence description.

Using a `/models/nano-banana-pro` page as an example, here’s the workflow to create a subpage with `shipany-page-builder`:

<Steps>

<Step>Trigger the skill with a prompt</Step>

Open a Coding Agent (such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview), or [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/)). In the chat, enter the prompt below to create a subpage with the `shipany-page-builder` skill.

```txt
use ".claude/skills/shipany-page-builder" to build a new page.
Page route is: /models/nano-banana-pro,
keywords: Nano Banana, Nano Banana Pro,
content reference: https://blog.google/technology/ai/nano-banana-pro/
```

In the prompt, specify the new page route, the keywords you want to cover, the content reference link, and any other details.

<Step>Use the skill to finish creating the subpage</Step>

After the skill is triggered, the Coding Agent will plan and execute the workflow defined in `shipany-page-builder` to create the page.

The changes typically include:

- Create the subpage content file: `src/config/locale/messages/{locale}/pages/{route}.json`
- Update the page config to add the new route: `src/config/locale/index.ts`

![](https://cdn.shipany.ai/imgs/6efa1c0b88afe29cffeb9e491554efef.png)

<Step>Preview the subpage</Step>

After creating the subpage, open the project preview URL in your browser and navigate to the route `/models/nano-banana-pro` to see the result.

![](https://cdn.shipany.ai/imgs/ce682b7be5d1e3295c5454d31f7cb767.png)

The subpage content uses random placeholder images generated by [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/).

You can continue editing the content and replace the placeholder images as needed.

</Steps>

With the steps above, you can use `shipany-page-builder` to quickly create a subpage.
